        "- Numpy-like API with GPU support\n",
        "- Pythonic object-oriented programming paradigm\n",
        "- Dynamic computation graph generation and execution\n",
        "- Automatic differentiation\n",

        "We will be using PyTorch for the programming assignments of this course. Thus, it is crucial to have clarity on how to build and train networks using torch.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three main components to any deep learning pipeline:\n",
        "1. **Data loading and preprocessing**: PyTorch provides `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` utilities to facilitate data fetching and batch collation.\n",
        "2.  **Model creation**: Most models can be created by subclassing `nn.Module` and overriding the `forward` method. The user does not need to implement the backprop, as it is handled by PyTorch's autograd system.\n",
        "3. **Model training**: Torch provides optimizers and losses through the `torch.optim` and `torch.nn` modules to be used during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these deserves their own place in the assignment, however in this assignment, we are going to focus only on the model creation and training. I have added some extra reading material in the end in case anyone is interested."
